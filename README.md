## Introduction

In this project, I built a comprehensive Active Directory Home Lab to demonstrate enterprise-level network administration and cybersecurity skills. This hands-on environment simulates real-world IT infrastructure, allowing me to practice Active Directory configuration, user management, Group Policy implementation, and security monitoring. The lab provides practical experience in network architecture, domain services, and Windows Server administration that directly translates to professional IT and cybersecurity roles.

The architecture of the Active Directory Home Lab consists of the following components:

- **Windows Server 2019** (Domain Controller)
- **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**
- **DNS Server**
- **DHCP Server**
- **Windows 10/11 Client Machines**
- **Virtual Network Configuration**
- **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)**
- **Organizational Units (OUs)**

## Lab Environment Details

### Domain Controller Setup

The Windows Server acts as the primary domain controller, hosting Active Directory Domain Services, DNS, and DHCP. This centralized configuration enables enterprise-level user authentication, resource management, and policy enforcement across the network.

### Network Configuration

The virtual network is configured to simulate a corporate environment with proper IP addressing, subnetting, and network services. Client machines are joined to the domain and receive automatic configuration through DHCP.

### Security Implementation

Security measures include password policies, account lockout policies, user permissions, and Group Policy configurations that enforce security baselines across all domain-joined machines.

## Key Features Implemented

- **User Account Management**: Created and managed user accounts, groups, and organizational units
- **Group Policy Administration**: Configured and deployed GPOs for security settings, software deployment, and user restrictions
- **DNS Configuration**: Set up forward and reverse lookup zones for proper name resolution
- **DHCP Services**: Automated IP address assignment and network configuration
- **Security Hardening**: Implemented security policies and access controls
- **Network Monitoring**: Configured event logging and security auditing

## Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases proficiency in:

- Windows Server Administration
- Active Directory Management
- Network Services Configuration (DNS, DHCP)
- Group Policy Implementation
- User and Computer Management
- Security Policy Enforcement
- Virtualization Technologies
- IT Infrastructure Design
